        The 4-4-4-4 Box Breathing Technique, also known as Square Breathing or
        Four-Square Breathing, is a powerful stress reliever and concentration
        enhancer. Developed by Navy SEALs to help maintain focus and composure
        during high-pressure situations, this technique involves inhaling for 4
        seconds, holding the breath for 4 seconds, exhaling for 4 seconds,
        holding the breath again for 4 seconds, and repeating the process.

        The 4-4-4-4 Box Breathing Technique is particularly effective for people
        who need to improve their focus, manage stress, or calm their nerves in

        practice.
