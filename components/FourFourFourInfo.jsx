        The 4-4-4-4 Box Breathing Technique, also known as Square Breathing or
        Four-Square Breathing, is a powerful stress reliever and concentration

        during high-pressure situations, this technique involves inhaling for 4
        seconds, holding the breath for 4 seconds, exhaling for 4 seconds,
        holding the breath again for 4 seconds, and repeating the process.
